# vertine
1.8.9 injectable client base | lunar ready

# requirements
https://github.com/VertineClient/vertine-injector : needed because it provides methods to get bytes of classes, and also a method to redefine them.

# warnings
this base won't work on forge nor vanilla</br>
you'll need to make a remapper and a transformer for non-public fields/methods
